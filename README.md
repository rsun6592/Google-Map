Food Truck Code

This Python script utilizes the Google Maps API to search for food trucks within a 5000 meter radius of the center of Indianapolis, IN. Afterwards the script collects pertinent information about these food trucks, including their names, addresses, ratings, user ratings totals, websites, opening hours, cuisine types, and geographic coordinates and store them in lists. The data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame and subsequently saved as a CSV file named "food_trucks_data.csv." This code serves as a practical example of how to access and process location-based data using the Google Maps API and store it in a structured format for future analysis or applications.
The data of nearby food trucks, along with their details, will be stored in the CSV file named "food_trucks_data.csv."
