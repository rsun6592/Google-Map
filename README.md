Food Truck Code

This Python script utilizes the Google Maps API to search for food trucks in Indianapolis, IN, and collects pertinent information about these food trucks, including their names, addresses, ratings, user ratings totals, websites, opening hours, cuisine types, and geographic coordinates. The data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame and subsequently saved as a CSV file named "food_trucks_data.csv." This code serves as a practical example of how to access and process location-based data using the Google Maps API and store it in a structured format for future analysis or applications.
